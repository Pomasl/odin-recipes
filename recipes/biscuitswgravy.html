    <h2>Biscuits & Gravy</h2>
    <p>Hot jumbo buttermilk biscuits with creamy sausage
         gravy are ready in just 15 minutes for a hearty, 
         family-favorite breakfast.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (19oz) can Southern-style flaky refrigerated biscuits (such as Pillsbury GrandsÂ®)</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package maple-flavored breakfast sausage</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
        <li>Arrange biscuits about 1 1/2 inches apart on a baking sheet</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 13 to 17 minutes. Slice cooked biscuits in half crosswise and keep warm</li>
        <li>While biscuits are baking, crumble sausage into a large skillet over medium heat; cook, breaking meat apart, until no longer pink inside, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle sausage and pan drippings with flour and cook and stir until sausage is coated, about 1 more minute. Reduce heat to medium-low</li>
        <li>Pour evaporated milk into sausage mixture, followed by milk; stir until thoroughly combined. Bring to a simmer, stirring constantly, and cook until gravy is your desired thickness, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt and ground black pepper. Stir butter into gravy until melted. Stir in more flour if gravy isn't thick enough.</li>
        <li>Place biscuits with cut sides up on serving plates; top with sausage gravy</li>
    </ol>
